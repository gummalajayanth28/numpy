# Data Science with NumPy

Welcome to the "Data Science with NumPy" repository! This project provides resources and examples for leveraging the NumPy library in data science tasks. NumPy is fundamental for numerical computing in Python, offering support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions.

## Overview

NumPy is a core library for numerical computations in Python, providing efficient array operations and mathematical functions. This repository includes tutorials, example scripts, and best practices for using NumPy effectively in your data science projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. It is also a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use myenv\Scripts\activate


### Installing NumPy

Install NumPy and other useful libraries with pip:

bash
pip install numpy
