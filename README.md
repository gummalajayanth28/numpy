# Data Science with NumPy

Welcome to the "Data Science with NumPy" repository! This project provides resources and examples for leveraging the NumPy library in data science tasks. NumPy is fundamental for numerical computing in Python, offering support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions.

## Overview

NumPy is a core library for numerical computations in Python, providing efficient array operations and mathematical functions. This repository includes tutorials, example scripts, and best practices for using NumPy effectively in your data science projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. It is also a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use myenv\Scripts\activate


### Installing NumPy

Install NumPy and other useful libraries with pip:

bash
pip install numpy


### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-with-numpy.git
cd data-science-with-numpy


## How to Use

### Running Examples

Navigate to the examples directory to find various scripts demonstrating different NumPy functionalities. Execute these scripts using:

bash
python example_script.py


### Basic Operations

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started with NumPy:

python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform basic operations
mean_value = np.mean(array)
print(f"Mean of the array: {mean_value}")

# Reshape the array
reshaped_array = array.reshape((5, 1))
print("Reshaped array:")
print(reshaped_array)

## Features

- Array Creation: Learn to create arrays and matrices with various data types.
- Mathematical Operations: Utilize NumPy functions for arithmetic operations, statistical calculations, and more.
- Array Manipulation: Techniques for reshaping, slicing, and aggregating arrays.
- Advanced Functions: Explore linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.
